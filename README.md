## `Overview of the PyBer ride-sharing analysis`	
	
The purpose for the analysis : 	
1. Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type	
2. Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 	
3. Summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer:	
    - T;	
    - .	
	
 Additionally, 
 So, the impact of changed data is explained in this report.	
## `Resources`	
The analysis was created using next resources:	
  - Data Source:  [Resources](./Resources/)	
  - Software: Python 3.8.8, Anaconda 4.10.3., Jupyter-notebook : 6.3.0.
