## `Overview of the PyBer ride-sharing analysis`	
	
The purpose for the PyBer ride-sharing analysis were: 	
1. Create and analyse a summary of the ride-sharing key metrics by city type.
2. Create and observe a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 	
3. Summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.	
## `Resources`	
The analysis was created using next resources:	
  - Data Source:  [Resources](./Resources/)	
  - Software: Python 3.8.8, Matplotlib 3.3.4, Pandas 1.2.4, Anaconda 4.10.3., Jupyter-notebook : 6.3.0.	
## `PyBer ride-sharing Analysis Result`	
	
Full results can be found in the [PyBer ride-sharing Analysis](./PyBer_Challenge.ipynb) file.	
  ### ` - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type`	

  - The ride-sharing summary by city type shows: the Total Rides, Total Drivers, the Total Fares, the Average Fare per Ride, and the Average Fare per Driver.

  Screen Summary DF

  - Multiple-line graph of the total weekly fares for each city type shows: the trend of Total Fares in $USD from January to the end of April 2019.

  ### ` - The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types`	

  from the summary DataFrame and , describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the , , t, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
T:

Based on the ride-sharing summary by city type analysis, the differences display below results:

  - Total rides column shows that the Total rides in Urban is 1,625, which is 2.6 times more than Surburban, and 13 times more than Rural city type.

  - Total drivers olumn shows that the Total Driver in Urban is 2,405, which is 4.9 times more than Surburban, and 30.83 times more than Rural city type.

  - Total fares 

  - The Average Fare per Ride in Rural is $34.62, which is 1.1 times more than Suburban, and 1.4 times more than Urban.

  - The Average Fare per Driver in Rural is $55.49, which is 1.4 times more compared to that of Suburban, and 3.3 times more of Urban

 Using images from multiple-line chart
  - The chart of Total Fare by CityType shows that comparing with Rural and Urban trend  Suburban area shows other trend  from last week of March till the end of April. 

  - Because, when Rural and Urban grow Suburban drops and it rockets from second week of April. It request additional analysis what it caused.

## `PyBer ride-sharing Analysis Summary`	

The analysis provides a lot of summarizing but the 3 can be chosen as main and essential business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
